    !   Each thread has its own copy of variables to modify
    !   Values are deleted after the scope of clause
    !   private variables are auto-initialized to 0 before usage!
    !   after scope, the variables assume the value prior to the scope

    !   Each thread has its own copy of variables to modify
    !   Values are deleted after the scope of clause
    !   private variables must be initialized before usage or garbage values are used!

    !   Values are deleted after the scope of clause
    !   private variables will be auto-initialized to 0 before usage!
    !   after scope, the variables assume the last value inside the scope
