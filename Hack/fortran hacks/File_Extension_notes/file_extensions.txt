Fixed-Format files:
    - Follows the punch-card format of old programming practices (prior to 1960's)
    - Strict 72/80 characters per line rule
        + In any line, you can have only 72/80 characters. Anything extra has to
          be moved to the next line!
    - Positions carry a significance
        + comments must begin at column 1 or after statement ends! or after column 7
        + actual commands must begin after 6 spaces!
        + Tabs can throw annoying warnings and are not recommended. Use spaces!
        + Line continuation character must be placed between columns 1 to 6

eg : .f, .ftn, .for, .f77, .F, .F77, .FTN, .F, .FOR

Free-Format files:
    - Punch-card format is ruled out
    - No 72/80 characters per line rule
    - Positions do not carry any significance and restrictions are removed
    - Tabs can be used instead of spaces. They might throw warnings, but are
      not errors!
    - Some changes in the syntax (but not to a great extend)
    - Still, you can follow the fixed format style if you wish!
    
eg : .f90, .f95, .f03, .f08, .F90, .F95, .F03, .F08

Lower case extensions may not allow pre-processor directives!
eg : .f90, .f95, .f03, .f08, .f, .ftn, .for, .f77

Upper case extensions allow pre-processor directives! You can produce lower-case
extension files from them!
eg : .F90, .F95, .F03, .F08, .F, .FTN, .FOR, .F77

Fixed formats are usually Fortran 77 or Fortran 1977

Free formats are usually advanced fortran and modern fortran

Legacy Fortran
.f, .F, .f77 and .F77 > Fortran 77 or Fortran 1997

Advanced Fortran
.f90 and .F90 > Fortran 90 or Fortran 1990
.f95 and .F95 > Fortran 95 or Fortran 1995

Modern Fortran
.f03 and .F03 > Fortran 03 or Fortran 2003
.f08 and .F08 > Fortran 08 or Fortran 2008

Speculative extension
.f15 and .F15 > Fortran 15 or Fortran 2015

Fortran programs prior to Fortran 77 (like fortran 66, fortran 4, fortran 3, 
fortran 2 and fortran 1) are (for most practical purposes) obsolete and extinct!
